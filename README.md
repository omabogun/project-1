# PROJECT-1
In this project we configured an EC2 instance and configured a new security group.  We also installed the Apache webserver and enable port 80 on our firewall to allow http traffic.  

After this we installed MySQL and secured the root access.  We then installed php to enable us run serverside scripting.

We finished by creating a new virtual host and disabling the default /var/www/html path.  We made index.php the default file and gave it priority over index.html and tested using a web browser.
